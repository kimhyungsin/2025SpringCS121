<p>In this part of the assignment you will create classes to represent a deck of playing cards that can be shuffled. A standard deck of playing cards consists of 52 cards. Each card is one of four suits: Clubs, Diamonds, Hearts, and Spades. There are 13 cards of each suit, each with its own rank: Ace, 2, 3, .., 9, 10, Jack, Queen, King. We will represent each card by an abbreviated rank and suit, such as ‚Äú2C‚Äù for the two of Clubs, ‚ÄúJH‚Äù for the Jack of Hearts, etc. Refer to the tables below for a full set of abbreviations.</p>

<p>In a brand new, factory-sealed deck of playing cards, the cards are placed in order of suit (Clubs, Diamonds, Hearts, then Spades) and, within each suit, in order of rank from Ace to King (A, 2, 3, ‚Ä¶, 9, 10, J, Q, then K).</p>

<p>The starter files contains three classes for this problem. You will complete some methods in Part 1 of the assignment, but others in Part 2.</p>
<ul>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Card.java</code>: represents a playing card, with a rank and suit. The constructor has been completed for you.
    <ul>
      <li>In Part 1, you will complete the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">toString()</code> method</li>
      <li>In Part 2, you will complete:
        <ul>
          <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">equals()</code></li>
          <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">hashCode()</code></li>

  </li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Deck.java</code>: an interface describing operations that can be performed on a deck of playing cards. <strong>Do not edit this file.</strong></li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ArrayDeck.java</code>: an implementation of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Deck</code> interface. It should store <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Card</code> objects in an array.
    <ul>
      <li>In Part 1, you will complete:

<p>The functionality and time performance requirements of the methods are specified in <strong>the comment sections</strong>.</p>

<h4 id="constructor">Constructor</h4>
<p>As we mentioned before, a standard deck has 52 cards. However, it will be easier to develop your code using smaller decks of cards. For this reason, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ArrayDeck</code>‚Äôs constructor has a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">maxRank</code> parameter. This constructor should create decks of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">4 * maxRank</code> cards in factory order. For example, invoking <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">new ArrayDeck(3)</code> should create a deck of 12 cards in the following order:</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>AC 2C 3C AD 2D 3D AH 2H 3H AS 2S 3S
</code></pre></div></div>

<h4 id="shuffling">Shuffling</h4>
<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ArrayDeck</code> must have two shuffling methods: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">outShuffle</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">inShuffle</code>.</p>

<p>The ‚Äúfaro out shuffle‚Äù splits a deck in half, interleaves the cards of the two halves, and leaves the original top card at the top and the original bottom card at the bottom. As an example, using the 12-card deck described above, an out shuffle would conceptually look like this:</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Index:           0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11
Unshuffled:     AC 2C 3C AD 2D 3D AH 2H 3H AS 2S 3S

1st half:       AC    2C    3C    AD    2D    3D
2nd half:          AH    2H    3H    AS    2S    3S

Result:         AC AH 2C 2H 3C 3H AD AS 2D 2S 3D 3S
Original Index:  0  6  1  7  2  8  3  9  4 10  5 11
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The ‚Äúfaro in shuffle‚Äù is slightly different. It splits a deck in half, interleaves the cards of the two halves, and moves the original top card to second and the original bottom card to second from the bottom. As an example, using a 12-card deck, an in shuffle would conceptually look like this:</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Index:           0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11
Unshuffled:     AC 2C 3C AD 2D 3D AH 2H 3H AS 2S 3S

1st half:          AC    2C    3C    AD    2D    3D
2nd half:       AH    2H    3H    AS    2S    3S

Result:         AH AC 2H 2C 3H 3C AS AD 2S 2D 3S 3D
Original Index:  6  0  7  1  8  2  9  3 10  4 11  5
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In Part 2 of the assignment, we will write code to find the number of out-shuffles and in-shuffles needed to bring a deck back to its factory order, as well as the shortest sequences of out-shuffles and in-shuffles needed to bring each card of a deck to the top of the deck.</p>
